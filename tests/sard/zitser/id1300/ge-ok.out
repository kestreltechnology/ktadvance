Before call to builfname, pw_gecos = Portmapper RPC user, and pw_name = rpc
nbuf before call to buildfname = 
sizeof(nbuf) = 5
snprintf (buf, buflen, format, gecos)
sizeof (buf) = 4
buflen = 5
strlen (gecos)=19
back from 1st call to buildfname
test_buf should be GOOD.  test_buf = GOOD
Real name of user rpc = Port

# ITC Benchmarks

### Description
Toyota Info Technology Center (ITC), U.S.A., static analysis benchmarks for
weaknesses in C, obtained from NIST SARD, Test Suite 104 (https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/view.php?count=20&tsID=104&first=0&sort=desc)
The test cases are organized in pairs: odd-numbered test cases have intended
vulnerabilities, which are fixed in the consecutive even-numbered test case.
Weaknesses and their fixes are indicated in the source code. Indications of
coincidental weaknesses have been added to the original test suite by SAMATE
staff at NIST.
